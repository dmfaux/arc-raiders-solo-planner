      "2x EMP or disruption grenades to strip ARC shields and stop abilities.",

      "Open with the Ferro from safe mid range and only swap to the Anvil or Vulcano when a boss is committing to you. Keep hard cover between you and open fields. Commit to a fight only if you have a clear extraction plan after the kill. Loot every segment of large ARC corpses for maximum XP, then rotate immediately to avoid squads drawn by the noise. If you spawn with poor sightlines, reposition first before starting a boss engagement.",

      "This build is about tempo. You are not here to clear every fight, you are here to tap every container and corpse you can find while staying ahead of the lobby. Only commit to fights that block your route or look like free third party kills. If you burn through half your shield rechargers or most of your meds, start angling towards your planned extraction rather than overextending.",
